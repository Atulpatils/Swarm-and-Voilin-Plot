# Types-of-Plots-in-Python-
There are various types of plots that can be created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Here are some commonly used types of plots:

1. Line Plot: A line plot represents data points connected by straight lines, useful for visualizing trends or patterns over time or continuous variables.

2. Scatter Plot: A scatter plot displays individual data points as dots on a graph, where the position on the x-axis and y-axis represents the values of two variables. It helps to identify relationships or correlations between variables.

3. Bar Plot: A bar plot shows categorical data with rectangular bars, where the height of each bar represents the frequency or value associated with a specific category. It is useful for comparing different categories or groups.

4. Histogram: A histogram displays the distribution of a continuous variable by dividing the data into intervals (bins) along the x-axis and representing the frequency or count of values falling into each bin on the y-axis.

5. Pie Chart: A pie chart represents data as slices of a circle, where each slice represents a proportion or percentage of a whole. It is suitable for displaying the composition or relative proportions of different categories.

6. Box Plot: A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, displays the summary statistics of a continuous variable, including the minimum, maximum, median, and quartiles. It provides a visual representation of the distribution and helps identify outliers.

7. Heatmap: A heatmap represents data using a grid of colors, where each cell's color represents the value of a variable. It is useful for visualizing relationships and patterns in large datasets.

8. Violin Plot: A violin plot combines a box plot and a kernel density plot, providing information about the distribution of a continuous variable as well as the summary statistics.
